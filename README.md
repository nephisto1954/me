## Software Engineer

Over 2 years ago, I decided to change my career and I learn to be a developer/engineer. I joined the LeWagon Bootcamp (RoR) and this kickstarted my transition.

The Javascript ecosystem has piqued my interest but I am not afraid of learning new tech (not limiting myself). I am at the start of my career and still have so much to learn. If you want someone to grow your team with, I believe that I would be a good candidate. I learn fast and I am flexible.

I am leaning more towards Front-end but given the right opportunity, I would love to further my knowledge and experience in Back-end as well.
